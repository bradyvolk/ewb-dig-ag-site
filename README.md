# Dig Ag React App

Digital Agriculture is a subteam within Cornell University's "Engineers Without Borders" Project Team. Our current project is centered around leveraging Computer Vision to identify and combat Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) disease in maize crop. This website serves as an informational guide and documentation source for potential users of our system. 

## Building, Deploying, Developing

Run these commands from within the `ewb-dig-ag-site` subfolder

To build the app:

```
npm run build
```

And then, to deploy:

```
firebase deploy
```

And if you want to develop the app without building and deploying everytime, you can develop locally with:

```
npm run start
```

Then, anytime you save, your local version of the site will be updated.

## Libraries In Use

As of now, we use a few libraries to make development easier.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) is used to deploy the application to our domain name https://ewb-dig-ag.org.

[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/) provides us with some basic components to maintain consistent style.

[Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) is used to make styling sections of content and components easier

## Suggested VSCode Extensions

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Simple React Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.simple-react-snippets)
- [Emmet HTML Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abusaidm.html-snippets)
- [vscode-styled-components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=styled-components.vscode-styled-components)

You Can add these settings to your `settings.json` to ensure the Prettier formatting and Emmet snippets work correctly:

```
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "[javascript]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "html"
  }
```

<br />
<br />

## Useful snippets

- `rce` used to create a React class component
- `rfce` used to create a React functional component
- `rconst` used to create a constructor and state in React class component
- `div` or any HTML tag name will automatically create the closing tag and add the chevrons
- `imr` or `imrc` to give the necessary import line for React and `imrc` also gives the import for component if you are making a class component

## Development Process (and Github command help)

1. To check current branch and to checkout `main`:

```
git branch 
git checkout main
git pull
```


2. To create new branch while `main` is checked out (-b means create new branch):

```
git checkout -b <ISSUEID#_branch-name>
```



4. Make changes in new branch:

5. Add commit and push your changes:

```
git add <path-to-files-you-changed>
git commit -m "Insert short commit message that answers question 'this commit will do what?'"
git push
```

6. If your upstream isn't set, when you run `git push` in step 5, it will suggest some command like the one below to set your upstream and push to it:

```
git push --set-upstream origin <insert your branch name>
```

- once command above is run (step 6), the URL for pull request
  will appear in command line output. Navigate to Pull Request page using URL.
- Make sure you are comparing your new branch to the main branch (main should
  be on the left hand side of the arrow)
- Then request reviewers (located on the right side of the UI)
