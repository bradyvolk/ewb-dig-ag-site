              Outbreaks of plant diseases, often left undetected, can be
              devastating for a local economy in Sub-Saharan Africa. To aid
              farmers, Engineers Without Borders at Cornell is building an
              airborne drone and a ground rover to assess large plots of crop
              fields real-time. The drone will provide a large aerial assessment
              of overall health which will then help the rover survey flagged
              parts for diseases underneath the canopy.
