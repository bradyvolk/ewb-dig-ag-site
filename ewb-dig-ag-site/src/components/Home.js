          <div className={styles.textJustify}>
          <p>Undetected outbreaks of disease in crops can be devastating for local 
          economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) is an example 
          of one of these diseases that is caused by a specific type of fungus. NLB 
          spreads rapidly from plant to plant, rendering large portions of maize crops 
          useless. With early detection of crop diseases, we can aid farmers with 
          disease-resistant breeding, monitoring of crops for new outbreaks, and strategic 
          control of fungicide deployment. Our goal is to build a non-commercialized, 
          open-source system that can employ deep learning algorithms to detect disease 
          symptoms before the disease spreads.</p>

          <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Our Approach</h2> 
          <div className={styles.textJustify}>
          <p>To aid farmers, Engineers Without Borders at Cornell is currently building 
            a drone and ground rover in order to assess large plots of crop fields for NLB 
            in real-time. The drone will detect infrared radiation to provide a large aerial 
            assessment of overall field health, which will direct the rover to survey flagged 
            sections of the field for diseases underneath the canopy. The Digital Agriculture 
            Project will design and implement an autonomous system consisting of a high-throughput 
            Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) that will work 
            side-by-side with farmers to assess levels of crop disease.</p>

          <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Our Solution</h2>
          <div className={styles.textJustify}>
          <p styles={styles.columnnal}>Initially, the drone (UAV) scans the field taking infrared photos. These infrared 
            “birds eye view” photos will indicate areas of possible outbreaks. At each of these 
            locations, the rover (UGV) will take close up images of the maize crop leaves. These 
            images are then run through a machine learning algorithm to detect NLB lesions. Finally, 
            the data from the rover is sent to an interface which will help the user pinpoint where 
            NLB exists in the field at the individual crop level. The user can then proceed to 
            appropriately address the threat. We believe that once implemented, our proposed system 
            will be the first innovative system to utilize UGVs in parallel with UAVs to detect plant 
            disease, providing an early warning detection system for researchers and farmers.</p>
